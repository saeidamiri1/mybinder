Growth factor-stimulated mTORC1 activation involves a AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of TSC1-TSC2, which leads to the activation of the RHEB GTPase that potently activates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1. Amino acid-signaling to mTORC1 requires its relocalization to the lysosomes mediated by the Ragulator complex and the Rag GTPases. Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. mTORC1 phosphorylates EIF4EBP1 and releases it from inhibiting the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E). mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates S6K1 at 'Thr-389', which then promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating PDCD4 and targeting it for degradation. Within mTORC1, AKT1S1 negatively regulates mTOR activity in a manner that is dependent on its phosphorylation state and binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Inhibits RHEB-GTP-dependent mTORC1 activation. Substrate for AKT1 phosphorylation, but can also be activated by AKT1-independent mechanisms. May also play a role in nerve growth factor-mediated neuroprotection. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16174443, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17277771, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17386266}.

stresses such as ionizing ultraviolet A light (UVA), thereby acting as a DNA damage sensor. Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.

Recruited to promoters upon gene activation together with histone acetyltransferases from EP300/P300 and p160 families, methylates histone H3 at 'Arg-17' (H3R17me), forming mainly asymmetric dimethylarginine (H3R17me2a), leading to activate transcription via chromatin remodeling. During nuclear hormone receptor activation and TCF7L2/TCF4 activation, acts synergically with EP300/P300 and either one of the p160 histone acetyltransferases NCOA1/SRC1, NCOA2/GRIP1 and NCOA3/ACTR or CTNNB1/beta-catenin to activate transcription. During myogenic transcriptional activation, acts together with NCOA3/ACTR as a coactivator for MEF2C. During monocyte inflammatory stimulation, acts together with EP300/P300 as a coactivator for NF-kappa-B. Acts as coactivator for PPARG, promotes adipocyte differentiation and the accumulation of brown fat tissue. Plays a role in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing by methylation of splicing factors. Also seems to be involved in p53/TP53 transcriptional activation. Methylates EP300/P300, both at 'Arg- 2142', which may loosen its interaction with NCOA2/GRIP1, and at 'Arg-580' and 'Arg-604' in the KIX domain, which impairs its interaction with CREB and inhibits CREB-dependent transcriptional activation. Also methylates arginine residues in RNA-binding proteins PABPC1, ELAVL1 and ELAV4, which may affect their mRNA- stabilizing properties and the half-life of their target mRNAs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19405910}.

May be involved in cell cycle progression through the regulation of cyclin D1/PRAD1 expression. Component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C) which has multiple functions during transcription by RNA polymerase II and is implicated in regulation of development and maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency. PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non- phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both indepentently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1. PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes. PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL. PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription. PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors. In case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1C associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription. Connects PAF1C with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex and the cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF) complex, and with Wnt signaling. Involved in polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15580289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15632063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15923622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16630820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16989776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19136632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19952111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20178742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20541477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21329879}.

Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus. May also indirectly participate in cellular volume control by activation of a swelling-induced chloride conductance pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11713266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161}.

Involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to chromatin insulators and preventing interaction between promoter and nearby enhancers and silencers. Acts as transcriptional repressor binding to promoters of vertebrate MYC gene and BAG1 gene. Also binds to the PLK and PIM1 promoters. Acts as a transcriptional activator of APP. Regulates APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster and controls MHC class II gene expression. Plays an essential role in oocyte and preimplantation embryo development by activating or repressing transcription. Seems to act as tumor suppressor. Plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation. Participates in the allele-specific gene expression at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus. On the maternal allele, binding within the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) mediates maternally inherited higher-order chromatin conformation to restrict enhancer access to IGF2. Plays a critical role in gene silencing over considerable distances in the genome. Preferentially interacts with unmethylated DNA, preventing spreading of CpG methylation and maintaining methylation-free zones. Inversely, binding to target sites is prevented by CpG methylation. Plays a important role in chromatin remodeling. Can dimerize when it is bound to different DNA sequences, mediating long-range chromatin looping. Mediates interchromosomal association between IGF2/H19 and WSB1/NF1 and may direct distant DNA segments to a common transcription factory. Causes local loss of histone acetylation and gain of histone methylation in the beta-globin locus, without affecting transcription. When bound to chromatin, it provides an anchor point for nucleosomes positioning. Seems to be essential for homologous X-chromosome pairing. May participate with Tsix in establishing a regulatable epigenetic switch for X chromosome inactivation.

Required for the assembly of F-actin structures, such as actin cables and stress fibers. Nucleates actin filaments. Binds to the barbed end of the actin filament and slows down actin polymerization and depolymerization. Required for cytokinesis, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor. DFR proteins couple Rho and Src tyrosine kinase during signaling and the regulation of actin dynamics. Functions as a scaffold protein for MAPRE1 and APC to stabilize microtubules and promote cell migration (By similarity). Has neurite outgrowth promoting activity (By similarity). In hear cells, it may play a role in the regulation of actin polymerization in hair cells. The MEMO1-RHOA- DIAPH1 signaling pathway plays an important role in ERBB2- dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. It controls the localization of APC and CLASP2 to the cell membrane, via the regulation of GSK3B activity. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of the MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization. Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Required in the control of cell shape (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987).

to viral infection and is also involved in the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Exerts its antiviral activity on a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus (MV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1). Inhibits viral replication via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2S1), this phosphorylation impairs the recycling of EIF2S1 between successive rounds of initiation leading to inhibition of translation which eventually results in shutdown of cellular and viral protein synthesis. Also phosphorylates other substrates including p53/TP53, PPP2R5A, DHX9, ILF3, IRS1 and the HHV-1 viral protein US11. In addition to serine/threonine-protein kinase activity, also has tyrosine-protein kinase activity and phosphorylates CDK1 at 'Tyr-4' upon DNA damage, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Either as an adapter protein and/or via its kinase activity, can regulate various signaling pathways (p38 MAP kinase, NF-kappa-B and insulin signaling pathways) and transcription factors (JUN, STAT1, STAT3, IRF1, ATF3) involved in the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via interaction with IKBKB and TRAF family of proteins and activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway via interaction with MAP2K6. Can act as both a positive and negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway (ISP). Negatively regulates ISP by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at 'Ser- 312' and positively regulates ISP via phosphorylation of PPP2R5A which activates FOXO1, which in turn up-regulates the expression of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2). Can regulate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Can trigger apoptosis via FADD-mediated activation of CASP8. Plays a role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton by binding to gelsolin (GSN), sequestering the protein in an inactive conformation away from actin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11836380, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15121867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15229216, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19189853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19229320, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19507191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19840259, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20171114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20685959, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21072047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21123651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21710204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22214662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22381929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22801494, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22948139, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23084476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23115276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23372823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23399035}.

Requires primed phosphorylation of the majority of its substrates. Contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GYS1 activity and hence glycogen synthesis. Regulates glycogen metabolism in liver, but not in muscle. May also mediate the development of insulin resistance by regulating activation of transcription factors. In Wnt signaling, regulates the level and transcriptional activity of nuclear CTNNB1/beta-catenin. Facilitates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and the generation of APP-derived amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer disease. May be involved in the regulation of replication in pancreatic beta-cells. Is necessary for the establishment of neuronal polarity and axon outgrowth.

Plays a central role in regulation of PI3K-dependent insulin signaling, although the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain unclear. While overexpression reduces both insulin-stimulated MAP kinase and Akt activation, its absence does not affect insulin signaling or GLUT4 trafficking. Confers resistance to dietary obesity. May act by regulating AKT2, but not AKT1, phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Part of a signaling pathway that regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Required for the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of actin structures as well as in endocytosis, having a major impact on ligand-induced EGFR internalization and degradation. Participates in regulation of cortical and submembraneous actin by hydrolyzing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 thereby regulating membrane ruffling (PubMed:21624956). Regulates cell adhesion and cell spreading. Required for HGF-mediated lamellipodium formation, cell scattering and spreading. Acts as a negative regulator of EPHA2 receptor endocytosis by inhibiting via PI3K-dependent Rac1 activation. Acts as a regulator of neuritogenesis by regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 level and is required to form an initial protrusive pattern, and later, maintain proper neurite outgrowth.

Mediates signaling from the FC-gamma-RIIB receptor (FCGR2B), playing a central role in terminating signal transduction from activating immune/hematopoietic cell receptor systems. Involved in EGF signaling pathway. Upon stimulation by EGF, it is recruited by EGFR and dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Plays a negative role in regulating the PI3K-PKB pathway, possibly by inhibiting PKB activity. Down-regulates Fc-gamma-R-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages independently of INPP5D/SHIP1. In macrophages, down-regulates NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription by regulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced signaling.

The homodimer has very low potassium channel activity, when expressed in heterologous systems, and can function as weakly inward rectifying potassium channel (PubMed:8605869, PubMed:8978667, PubMed:15820677, PubMed:21653227, PubMed:22431633, PubMed:23169818, PubMed:25001086). Channel activity is modulated by activation of serotonin receptors (By similarity). Heterodimeric channels containing KCNK1 and KCNK2 have much higher activity, and may represent the predominant form in astrocytes (By similarity). Heterodimeric channels containing KCNK1 and KCNK3 or KCNK9 have much higher activity (PubMed:23169818). Heterodimeric channels formed by KCNK1 and KCNK9 may contribute to halothane- sensitive currents (PubMed:23169818). Mediates outward rectifying potassium currents in dentate gyrus granule cells and contributes to the regulation of their resting membrane potential (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of action potential firing in dentate gyrus granule cells and down-regulates their intrinsic excitability (By similarity). In astrocytes, the heterodimer formed by KCNK1 and KCNK2 is required for rapid glutamate release in response to activation of G-protein coupled receptors, such as F2R and CNR1 (By similarity). Required for normal ion and water transport in the kidney (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of the resting membrane potential of pancreatic beta cells (By similarity). The low channel activity of homodimeric KCNK1 may be due to sumoylation (PubMed:15820677, PubMed:20498050, PubMed:23169818). The low channel activity may be due to rapid internalization from the cell membrane and retention in recycling endosomes (PubMed:19959478). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08581, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2T2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15820677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17693262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19959478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20498050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21653227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22431633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23169818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25001086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8605869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978667}.

Acting autonomously, serves itself as NLS receptor. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re- exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in respons to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint.

MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2. MAPK14 interacts also with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53. In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF- induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3. MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9. Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14- mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A. The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF- kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation. Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation. The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc-N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression. Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113'. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10943842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11333986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15905572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16932740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17003045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17724032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19893488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20188673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20932473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9430721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9792677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9858528}.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10393181, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10617468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12356731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12974390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15788397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15952796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8325880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9155018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9480836}.

Growth factor-stimulated mTORC1 activation involves a AKT1- mediated phosphorylation of TSC1-TSC2, which leads to the activation of the RHEB GTPase that potently activates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1. Amino acid-signaling to mTORC1 requires its relocalization to the lysosomes mediated by the Ragulator complex and the Rag GTPases. Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. mTORC1 phosphorylates EIF4EBP1 and releases it from inhibiting the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E). mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates S6K1 at 'Thr-389', which then promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating PDCD4 and targeting it for degradation. Within mTORC1, LST8 interacts directly with MTOR and enhances its kinase activity. In nutrient- poor conditions, stabilizes the MTOR-RPTOR interaction and favors RPTOR-mediated inhibition of MTOR activity. mTORC2 is also activated by growth factors, but seems to be nutrient-insensitive. mTORC2 seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, probably by activating one or more Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors. mTORC2 promotes the serum- induced formation of stress-fibers or F-actin. mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 'Ser-473' phosphorylation, which may facilitate the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation. mTORC2 regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422'. mTORC2 also modulates the phosphorylation of PRKCA on 'Ser-657'. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15467718}.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2). Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4. Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1- mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1- pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex. Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor. In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1. To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A. mTORC1 also negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1. Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser- 758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1. Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP. mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor. Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules. As part of the mTORC2 complex MTOR may regulate other cellular processes including survival and organization of the cytoskeleton. Plays a critical role in the phosphorylation at 'Ser-473' of AKT1, a pro-survival effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, facilitating its activation by PDK1. mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B. mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422'. Regulates osteoclastogensis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JLN9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12087098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14651849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15268862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15467718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15545625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15718470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18497260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18762023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20516213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20537536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429704}.

The CBC complex is involved in mRNA export from the nucleus via its interaction with ALYREF/THOC4/ALY, leading to the recruitment of the mRNA export machinery to the 5' end of mRNA and to mRNA export in a 5' to 3' direction through the nuclear pore. The CBC complex is also involved in mediating U snRNA and intronless mRNAs export from the nucleus. The CBC complex is essential for a pioneer round of mRNA translation, before steady state translation when the CBC complex is replaced by cytoplasmic cap-binding protein eIF4E. The pioneer round of mRNA translation mediated by the CBC complex plays a central role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), NMD only taking place in mRNAs bound to the CBC complex, but not on eIF4E-bound mRNAs. The CBC complex enhances NMD in mRNAs containing at least one exon-junction complex (EJC) via its interaction with UPF1, promoting the interaction between UPF1 and UPF2. The CBC complex is also involved in 'failsafe' NMD, which is independent of the EJC complex, while it does not participate in Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). During cell proliferation, the CBC complex is also involved in microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis via its interaction with SRRT/ARS2, thereby being required for miRNA- mediated RNA interference. The CBC complex also acts as a negative regulator of PARN, thereby acting as an inhibitor of mRNA deadenylation. In the CBC complex, NCBP2/CBP20 recognizes and binds capped RNAs (m7GpppG-capped RNA) but requires NCBP1/CBP80 to stabilize the movement of its N-terminal loop and lock the CBC into a high affinity cap-binding state with the cap structure. The conventional cap-binding complex with NCBP2 binds both small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and messenger (mRNA) and is involved in their export from the nucleus (PubMed:26382858). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11551508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15361857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17190602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17363367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17873884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18369367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19632182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26382858}.

Binds the conventional octamer sequence in double-stranded DNA. Also binds single-stranded DNA and RNA at a site independent of the duplex site. Involved in pre-mRNA splicing, probably as a heterodimer with SFPQ. Interacts with U5 snRNA, probably by binding to a purine-rich sequence located on the 3' side of U5 snRNA stem 1b. Together with PSPC1, required for the formation of nuclear paraspeckles. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA unwinding by modulating the function of topoisomerase I/TOP1. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination and may stabilize paired DNA ends. In vitro, the complex strongly stimulates DNA end joining, binds directly to the DNA substrates and cooperates with the Ku70/G22P1-Ku80/XRCC5 (Ku) dimer to establish a functional preligation complex. NONO is involved in transcriptional regulation. The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP- dependent transcriptional avtivity. NONO binds to an enhancer element in long terminal repeats of endogenous intracisternal A particles (IAPs) and activates transcription. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10858305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11525732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11897684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15590677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22416126}.

PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non- phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both indepentently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1. PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes. PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL. PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription. PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors.

Activation by the binding of active CDC42 and RAC1 results in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues. Full-length PAK2 stimulates cell survival and cell growth. Phosphorylates MAPK4 and MAPK6 and activates the downstream target MAPKAPK5, a regulator of F-actin polymerization and cell migration. Phosphorylates JUN and plays an important role in EGF- induced cell proliferation. Phosphorylates many other substrates including histone H4 to promote assembly of H3.3 and H4 into nucleosomes, BAD, ribosomal protein S6, or MBP. Additionally, associates with ARHGEF7 and GIT1 to perform kinase-independent functions such as spindle orientation control during mitosis. On the other hand, apoptotic stimuli such as DNA damage lead to caspase-mediated cleavage of PAK2, generating PAK-2p34, an active p34 fragment that translocates to the nucleus and promotes cellular apoptosis involving the JNK signaling pathway.

Polo-like kinase proteins acts by binding and phosphorylating proteins are that already phosphorylated on a specific motif recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates BORA, BUB1B/BUBR1, CCNB1, CDC25C, CEP55, ECT2, ERCC6L, FBXO5/EMI1, FOXM1, KIF20A/MKLP2, CENPU, NEDD1, NINL, NPM1, NUDC, PKMYT1/MYT1, KIZ, PPP1R12A/MYPT1, PRC1, RACGAP1/CYK4, SGOL1, STAG2/SA2, TEX14, TOPORS, p73/TP73, TPT1 and WEE1. Plays a key role in centrosome functions and the assembly of bipolar spindles by phosphorylating KIZ, NEDD1 and NINL. NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation. Phosphorylation of NINL component of the centrosome leads to NINL dissociation from other centrosomal proteins. Involved in mitosis exit and cytokinesis by phosphorylating CEP55, ECT2, KIF20A/MKLP2, CENPU, PRC1 and RACGAP1. Recruited at the central spindle by phosphorylating and docking PRC1 and KIF20A/MKLP2; creates its own docking sites on PRC1 and KIF20A/MKLP2 by mediating phosphorylation of sites subsequently recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates RACGAP1, thereby creating a docking site for the Rho GTP exchange factor ECT2 that is essential for the cleavage furrow formation. Promotes the central spindle recruitment of ECT2. Plays a central role in G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle by phosphorylating CCNB1, CDC25C, FOXM1, CENPU, PKMYT1/MYT1, PPP1R12A/MYPT1 and WEE1. Part of a regulatory circuit that promotes the activation of CDK1 by phosphorylating the positive regulator CDC25C and inhibiting the negative regulators WEE1 and PKMYT1/MYT1. Also acts by mediating phosphorylation of cyclin-B1 (CCNB1) on centrosomes in prophase. Phosphorylates FOXM1, a key mitotic transcription regulator, leading to enhance FOXM1 transcriptional activity. Involved in kinetochore functions and sister chromatid cohesion by phosphorylating BUB1B/BUBR1, FBXO5/EMI1 and STAG2/SA2. PLK1 is high on non-attached kinetochores suggesting a role of PLK1 in kinetochore attachment or in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) regulation. Required for kinetochore localization of BUB1B. Regulates the dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes by phosphorylating cohesin subunits such as STAG2/SA2. Phosphorylates SGOL1: required for spindle pole localization of isoform 3 of SGOL1 and plays a role in regulating its centriole cohesion function. Mediates phosphorylation of FBXO5/EMI1, a negative regulator of the APC/C complex during prophase, leading to FBXO5/EMI1 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Acts as a negative regulator of p53 family members: phosphorylates TOPORS, leading to inhibit the sumoylation of p53/TP53 and simultaneously enhance the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates the transactivation domain of the transcription factor p73/TP73, leading to inhibit p73/TP73-mediated transcriptional activation and pro-apoptotic functions. Phosphorylates BORA, and thereby promotes the degradation of BORA. Contributes to the regulation of AURKA function. Also required for recovery after DNA damage checkpoint and entry into mitosis. Phosphorylates MISP, leading to stabilization of cortical and astral microtubule attachments required for proper spindle positioning (PubMed:8991084, PubMed:11202906, PubMed:12207013, PubMed:12447691, PubMed:12524548, PubMed:12738781, PubMed:12852856, PubMed:12939256, PubMed:14532005, PubMed:14734534, PubMed:15070733, PubMed:15148369, PubMed:15469984, PubMed:16198290, PubMed:16247472, PubMed:16980960, PubMed:17081991, PubMed:17351640, PubMed:17376779, PubMed:17617734, PubMed:18174154, PubMed:18331714, PubMed:18418051, PubMed:18477460, PubMed:18521620, PubMed:18615013, PubMed:19160488, PubMed:19351716, PubMed:19468300, PubMed:19468302, PubMed:19473992, PubMed:19509060, PubMed:19597481, PubMed:23455478, PubMed:23509069).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)- dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B- ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF- kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF- kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.

In cultured neurons, prevents amyloid beta protein-induced apoptosis by interrupting cell death process at a very early step. In glioblastoma cells, may function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) and PDPK1 in the promotion of cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic factor BAD. Can form a protein complex in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with PARD6A and ECT2 and regulate ECT2 oncogenic activity by phosphorylation, which in turn promotes transformed growth and invasion. In response to nerve growth factor (NGF), acts downstream of SRC to phosphorylate and activate IRAK1, allowing the subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B and neuronal cell survival. Functions in the organization of the apical domain in epithelial cells by phosphorylating EZR. This step is crucial for activation and normal distribution of EZR at the early stages of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. Forms a protein complex with LLGL1 and PARD6B independently of PARD3 to regulate epithelial cell polarity. Plays a role in microtubule dynamics in the early secretory pathway through interaction with RAB2A and GAPDH and recruitment to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs). In human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), is activated by saturated fatty acids and mediates lipid-induced apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10356400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10467349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10906326, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11042363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11724794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12871960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14684752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15994303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18270268, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19327373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21189248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21419810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8226978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9346882}.

Methylates GM130/GOLGA2, regulating Golgi ribbon formation (PubMed:20421892). Methylates H4R3 in genes involved in glioblastomagenesis in a CHTOP- and/or TET1-dependent manner (PubMed:25284789). Symmetrically methylates POLR2A, a modification that allows the recruitment to POLR2A of proteins including SMN1/SMN2 and SETX. This is required for resolving RNA-DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II, that form R-loop in transcription terminal regions, an important step in proper transcription termination (PubMed:26700805). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CIG8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11152681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11747828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12411503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737618, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17709427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20159986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20421892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20810653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21258366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21917714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22269951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25284789, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26700805}.

Core component of the PRP19C/Prp19 complex/NTC/Nineteen complex which is part of the spliceosome and participates in its assembly, its remodeling and is required for its activity. During assembly of the spliceosome, mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the U4 spliceosomal protein PRPF3. Ubiquitination of PRPF3 allows its recognition by the U5 component PRPF8 and stabilizes the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP spliceosomal complex (PubMed:20595234). Recruited to RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the pre-mRNA, it may also couple the transcriptional and spliceosomal machineries (PubMed:21536736). The XAB2 complex, which contains PRPF19, is also involved in pre- mRNA splicing, transcription and transcription-coupled repair (PubMed:17981804). Beside its role in pre-mRNA splicing PRPF19, as part of the PRP19-CDC5L complex, plays a role in the DNA damage response/DDR. It is recruited to the sites of DNA damage by the RPA complex where PRPF19 directly ubiquitinates RPA1 and RPA2. 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the RPA complex allows the recruitment of the ATR-ATRIP complex and the activation of ATR, a master regulator of the DNA damage response (PubMed:24332808). May also play a role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by recruiting the repair factor SETMAR to altered DNA (PubMed:18263876). As part of the PSO4 complex may also be involved in the DNA interstrand cross-links/ICLs repair process (PubMed:16223718). In addition, may also mediate 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates and play a role in proteasomal degradation (PubMed:11435423). May play a role in the biogenesis of lipid droplets (By similarity). May play a role in neural differentiation possibly through its function as part of the spliceosome (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99KP6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JMJ4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11082287, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11435423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12960389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15660529, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16223718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16332694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16388800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18263876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21536736, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24332808, ECO:0000303|PubMed:17981804, ECO:0000303|PubMed:20595234}.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 &gt; PtdIns(3,4)P2 &gt; PtdIns3P &gt; Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue.

NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor which is present in almost all cell types and is involved in many biological processed such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF- kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF- kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus.

It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage. In the cellular response to DNA damage, the RPA complex controls DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Through recruitment of ATRIP activates the ATR kinase a master regulator of the DNA damage response. It is required for the recruitment of the DNA double-strand break repair factors RAD51 and RAD52 to chromatin in response to DNA damage. Also recruits to sites of DNA damage proteins like XPA and XPG that are involved in nucleotide excision repair and is required for this mechanism of DNA repair. Plays also a role in base excision repair (BER) probably through interaction with UNG. Through RFWD3 may activate CHEK1 and play a role in replication checkpoint control.

Isoform 2 anti-apoptotic activity is mediated by inhibition of the GZMA-activated DNase, NME1. In the course of cytotoxic T- lymphocyte (CTL)-induced apoptosis, GZMA cleaves SET, disrupting its binding to NME1 and releasing NME1 inhibition. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 inhibit EP300/CREBBP and PCAF-mediated acetylation of histones (HAT) and nucleosomes, most probably by masking the accessibility of lysines of histones to the acetylases. The predominant target for inhibition is histone H4. HAT inhibition leads to silencing of HAT-dependent transcription and prevents active demethylation of DNA. Both isoforms stimulate DNA replication of the adenovirus genome complexed with viral core proteins; however, isoform 2 specific activity is higher. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12628186}.

Acts as a versatile DIDS-sensitive inorganic and organic anion transporter that mediates the uptake of monovalent anions like chloride, bicarbonate, formate and hydroxyl ion and divalent anions like sulfate and oxalate. Function in multiple exchange modes involving pairs of these anions, which include chloride-bicarbonate, chloride-oxalate, oxalate-formate, oxalate-sulfate and chloride- formate exchange. Apical membrane chloride-bicarbonate exchanger that mediates luminal chloride absorption and bicarbonate secretion by the small intestinal brush border membrane and contributes to intracellular pH regulation in the duodenal upper villous epithelium during proton-coupled peptide absorption, possibly by providing a bicarbonate import pathway. Mediates also intestinal chloride absorption and oxalate secretion, thereby preventing hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Transepithelial oxalate secretion, chloride-formate, chloride- oxalate and chloride-bicarbonate transport activities in the duodenum are inhibited by PKC activation in a calcium-independent manner. The apical membrane chloride-bicarbonate exchanger provides also a major route for fluid and bicarbonate secretion into the proximal tubules of the kidney as well as into the proximal part of the interlobular pancreatic ductal tree, where it mediates electrogenic chloride-bicarbonate exchange with a chloride-bicarbonate stoichiometry of 1:2, and hence will dilute and alkalinize protein-rich acinar secretion. Mediates also the transcellular sulfate absorption and oxalate secretion across the apical membrane in the duodenum and the formate ion efflux at the apical brush border of cells in the proximal tubules of kidney.

During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF).

Hydrolyzes 5'- phosphoglycolates on protruding 5' ends on DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) due to DNA damage by radiation and free radicals. The 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity can enable the repair of TOP2-induced DSBs without the need for nuclease activity, creating a 'clean' DSB with 5'-phosphate termini that are ready for ligation. Has preference for single-stranded DNA or duplex DNA with a 4 base pair overhang as substrate. Has also 3'- tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity, but less efficiently and much slower than TDP1. Constitutes the major if not only 5'- tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase in cells. Also acts as a 5'-tyrosyl- RNA phosphodiesterase following picornavirus infection: its activity is hijacked by picornavirus and acts by specifically cleaving the protein-RNA covalent linkage generated during the viral genomic RNA replication steps of a picornavirus infection, without impairing the integrity of viral RNA. Also acts as an adapter by participating in the specific activation of MAP3K7/TAK1 in response to TGF-beta: associates with components of the TGF- beta receptor-TRAF6-TAK1 signaling module and promotes their ubiquitination dependent complex formation.

Instead, it is required to negatively regulate telomere recombination and is essential for repressing homology-directed repair (HDR), which can affect telomere length. Does not bind DNA directly: recruited to telomeric double-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats via its interaction with TERF2.

Functions as a scaffolding element in the nuclear phase of the NPC essential for normal nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and mRNAs, plays a role in the establishment of nuclear-peripheral chromatin compartmentalization in interphase, and in the mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling during mitosis. Involved in the quality control and retention of unspliced mRNAs in the nucleus; in association with NUP153, regulates the nuclear export of unspliced mRNA species bearing constitutive transport element (CTE) in a NXF1- and KHDRBS1-independent manner. Negatively regulates both the association of CTE-containing mRNA with large polyribosomes and translation initiation. Does not play any role in Rev response element (RRE)-mediated export of unspliced mRNAs. Implicated in nuclear export of mRNAs transcribed from heat shock gene promoters; associates both with chromatin in the HSP70 promoter and with mRNAs transcribed from this promoter under stress-induced conditions. Modulates the nucleocytoplasmic transport of activated MAPK1/ERK2 and huntingtin/HTT and may serve as a docking site for the XPO1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export complex. According to some authors, plays a limited role in the regulation of nuclear protein export (PubMed:22253824 and PubMed:11952838). Plays also a role as a structural and functional element of the perinuclear chromatin distribution; involved in the formation and/or maintenance of NPC-associated perinuclear heterochromatin exclusion zones (HEZs). Finally, acts as a spatial regulator of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) response ensuring a timely and effective recruitment of spindle checkpoint proteins like MAD1L1 and MAD2L1 to unattached kinetochore during the metaphase-anaphase transition before chromosome congression. Its N-terminus is involved in activation of oncogenic kinases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11952838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15654337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17897941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18981471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19273613, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20133940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20407419, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21613532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22253824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9864356}.

Component of a regulatory loop that controls autophagy and p53/TP53 levels: mediates deubiquitination of BECN1, a key regulator of autophagy, leading to stabilize the PIK3C3/VPS34- containing complexes. In turn, PIK3C3/VPS34-containing complexes regulate USP10 stability, suggesting the existence of a regulatory system by which PIK3C3/VPS34-containing complexes regulate p53/TP53 protein levels via USP10 and USP13. Does not deubiquitinate MDM2. Deubiquitinates CFTR in early endosomes, enhancing its endocytic recycling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11439350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18632802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19398555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20096447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21962518}.
